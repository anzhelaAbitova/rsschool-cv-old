        <p>My main goal is to become a successful web-developer. Now I engage in web-design. But I 
        find coding much more fascinating and reliable. I have to admit my lack of actual experience. 
        All projects I did contribute were training. But I do learn fast, especially when I'm 
        inspired. And I'm inspired to learn coding.</p>
        <p>I know HTML, CSS and currently trying to learn JavaScript and GIT.</p>
        <p>Education that I've had so far are course Web-design at Samara University, courses at HTML 
        Academy and various online-seminars (mostly Skillbox), a lot of books and articles. </p>
        <p>I have learned English at school, then had three courses at university. For the most part 
        all practice I had with English is reading a lot and watching courses.</p>
        <p>As I said previously I've had contributed to some training projects, links provided above, and had 
        badges at HTML Academy.</p>
